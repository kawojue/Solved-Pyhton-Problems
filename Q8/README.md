# Pb Numbers

The file pbnumbers.txt contains the winning lottery numbers selected weekly between February 3, 2010 and May 11, 2016. (The file contains 654 sets of winning numbers). Each line in the file contains the set of six winning numbers that we selected on a given date. The numbers are separated by a space and the last number in each line is the complementary number for that day.

For example, the first line in the file shows the numbers for February 3 2010, which were 17, 22, 36, 37, 52 and the complementary number is 24.

Write a program that will work with this file to search through the file and display the 10 most common numbers ordered by frequency. The program should then display the 10 least common numbers.
