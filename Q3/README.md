# Q3 - Paint Estimate

A painting company has determined that for every 112 square feet of wall space, one gallon of paint
is required. The company charges $25.00 per hour for labour. Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of square feet of wall space to be painted and the price of the paint per gallon.
The program should then display the following data.

1. The number of gallons of paint required
2. The cost of the paint
3. The hours of labour required to complete the job
4. The cost of the labour to complete the job
5. The total cost of the paint job.
Assume that the program will run only once for each estimate.
