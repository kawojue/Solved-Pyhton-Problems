# World Series Winner

This file contains the chronological list of World Series winning teams from 1903 to 2019. The first line in the file is the name of the team that one in 1903 and the last line is the name of the team that won in 2019.

(Note: The World series was not played in 1904 nor in 1994.)

Write a program that lets the user enter the name of a team (As it appears in the file), then displays the number of times that team has won the World Series in the time period from 1903 to 2019. Be sure to include exception handling.

Hint: Read the contents of the file into a list, and after the user enters the name of the team, the program should step through the list to count the number of times the selected team appears.
